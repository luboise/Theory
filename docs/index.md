# Theory

Welcome to Theory, an all encompassing soflan guide for IIDX 27 charts and earlier. Here you will find soflan techniques, as well as varying individual guides for soflan charts that I hope you will find useful.

This website was previously hosted at [http://testtheory.altervista.org](http://testtheory.altervista.org) and should now correctly link here.

## Aim

The aim of this website is to bridge the gap between soflan players and players who either don't have the time for finding out techniques for themselves, or don't find the enjoyment in doing so. Whether you are just here because theres a lamp you want or you want to improve, this site should have what you want.

## Resources

All chart previews and click tracks listed are credited but linked without permission.

Any images of charts you see (the images that I usually circle in blue and purple) are taken from [Textage](https://textage.cc/score/). Excellent website and resource for analysing patterns, rolling randoms and working out soflan tech.
