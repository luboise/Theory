## Method 1: Double lane cover removal

Marie Antoinette goes from 215BPM -> 205BPM -> 248BPM.

The first change is towards the beginning, and can be (but doesn't need to be) mitigated by using a lane cover off and back on. The reason to do this instead of floating is because this section can be easily 1 handed, while you use your other hand to turn the lane cover back on.

Lane cover off at blue, lane cover on at any purple.

Optimal lane cover is 173WN. For the ending speedup section there is a similar large gap where you can turn off your lane cover. Hit the first chunk (between blue and purple) with your lane cover off, and then switch it back on at any of the purple lines. This is relatively safe as long as you can read the first pattern without a lane cover. If you can't read 173WN, any larger WN will work fine. It will just be slower than you normally read while the lane cover is off.

## Method 2: Gear Shift

Depending on your Green Number, you might be able to just shift down 1 or 2 in the blue circle in the image above to cover the speedup. If you can do this it is way easier and more consistent, but this method in itself doesn't cover as wide of a range of Green Numbers and will likely require you to fiddle with your lane cover to find a comfortable shift.

## Method 3: Float

If neither Method 1 or 2 work for you, you can just float the chart once you reach the speedup. It's relatively safe, even for holding a hard clear. Similar to Method 1, the initial float is optional.
