## ☆☆☆☆☆ Set for 189 or No Tech

The BPM change is at the beginning and changes the song from 182BPM to 189BPM. You can no-tech this if you're comfortable with reading a bit fast, but the better option is to just read the beginning a bit slower and set your minimum GN to your regular GN (`1.0385 * Regular GN` for older styles).

Just put up your GN by about 5 and it should be good enough.
