## ☆☆☆☆☆ Float Float Float!

The song starts at 101BPM, has a large break before jumping to 202BPM. Float any time during that break.

There is a similar break at the end where the song transitions back to 101BPM. You can float it but there are only 5 notes left in the chart, so you can easily read it slow.

This is a good chart to learn how to save your WN by tapping Start 4 times instead of floating.
