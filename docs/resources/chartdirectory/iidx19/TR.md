## Method 1: No tech

TITANS RETURN SPL is a tricky chart to combo and time well. While the NC is trivial if you can hit HCN, this is more for the HC. I recommend no tech, learn the scratch pattern and replicate it. You can almost comfortably 1 hand the notes on any random, but non-ran is also fine. If you are losing all of your gauge to the density at the end of the slow sections, play on non-ran or mirror. This will give comfortable stair like patterns (check chart preview).

Be careful of the backspin scratch in the second slowdown section as it can definitely catch you off guard.

If studying scratch patterns isn't for you, play TITANS RETURN SPA. It has the exact same scratch patterns (only missing the backspin) but with nerfed density, letting you learn the scratch patterns naturally.

## Method 2: Float.

If you're purely playing for score, you can just float the chart 4 times (once after each BPM change).
