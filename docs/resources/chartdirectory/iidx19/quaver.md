## No tech required!

quaver starts at 182BPM and works its way up to 186BPM slowly over the course of the chart. This means that by the end of the chart your Green Number will be 2.50% lower than normal! Absolutely unreadable.

In all seriousness, quaver doesn't require tech. If you have OCD or something, just adjust the scroll so that the lowest GN of the chart is your regular Base GN.
