## Method 1: Gear shift down, then back up

As the majority of the 300BPM section in JOMANDA is low density, you can just read it fast. That being said, you'll still need to do some tech.

This method will require tweaking. If when you gear shift down by 1 it is still too difficult to read, consider lowering your SUDDEN+ cover or raising your lift higher to accomodate the higher speed of the chart. **Be wary not to accidentally float when gear shifting back up!**

1. **Gear shift down 1** at the beginning of the slowdown (marked in purple). If you are struggling to do this and are comfortable reading slow, you can opt to gear shift down earlier in the chart (circled in blue)
2. Read the slowdown slow and the speedup fast
3. **Gear shift back up by 1 after the scratch** circled in green
4. Read the rest of the chart normally

## Method 2: Pre-float + read slow

Method 2 is completely overkill, but I thought I'd keep it here anyway.

This strategy focuses more on the transition between the speedup and the rest of the chart rather than focusing on the speedup. If you're comfy with reading slow and reading fast, method 1 is heavily advised. If you can get through the first 10 seconds of the speedup, it becomes much easier.

1. Set your Base GN to ``0.65 * current GN`` (0.65 = 195/300)
2. Gear shift back to your regular GN
3. Gear shift down 1 or 2 at the end of the slowdown depending on how fast you can read (marked with purple line above)
4. Float on the final scratch during the speedup (circled in green above)
5. The rest of the chart will be at your regular reading speed

If you're good at reading slow and struggle to fit in gear shifts without breaking combo, you can gear shift in the larger gap before the speedup instead (circled in blue above).
