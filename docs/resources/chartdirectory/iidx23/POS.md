## No tech really viable

I wouldn't recommend trying to tech this chart. The BPM changes very frequently and always returns to 185BPM when not in a soflan section, so keeping your Base GN centered around 185BPM makes the most sense.

This chart has 2 major slowdowns to half BPM, both of which actually drop even lower to 23BPM, and then returns to 185BPM after each one.

While I won't provide any tech in this guide, I will provide this video that I made of POSSESSION without any background keysounds so that you can learn the patterns without all of the other instruments blasting in the song, and know which keysounds your taps are mapped to.

I'll also provide a link to this clap track/consistent BPM guide for POSSESSION created by IIDX EZREAL. Another helpful video to help visualise/memorise the BPM changes in this chart.

If you have (or find) any useful tech for POSSESSION and think it could belong in this guide, feel free to message me using the contact info on the [Home](../../../index.md) page or submit it via the [GitHub page](https://github.com/playtime881/Theory) for this guide under the main branch.
