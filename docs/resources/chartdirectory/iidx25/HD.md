## Float after slowdown

Hella Deep, much like almost every other MASAYOSHI IIMORI chart, has a gradual slowdown into an easy float. For Hella Deep, you can safely float any time after the backspin scratch, but I'll put some recommended float spots here. Keep in mind that you can **float while hitting a scratch note** simply by holding start.
