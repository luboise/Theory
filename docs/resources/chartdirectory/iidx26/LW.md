## ★★★★☆ No tech/nonran

Lethal weapon's soflan section comes right after the first chorus, and isn't too dense as long as you can make out the rhythm. If you're struggling to read it, it's a lot more spread out on non-ran/mirror. I **recommend against floating** this section as floating back to normal afterwards is difficult during the dense streams.

If floating is is mandatory, it is viable on this chart.
