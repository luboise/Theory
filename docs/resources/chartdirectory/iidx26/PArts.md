## ★★☆☆☆ Method 1: LIFT Substitute

Combine your LIFT and SUDDEN+ together into your LIFT value, and then set your SUDDEN+ to `1000 - LIFT \* 74`. Turn off your SUDDEN+ just before the speedup or as the speedup is beginning and you're set for the whole chart.

## ★☆☆☆☆ Set for 175

As Particle Arts starts at 165BPM and gradually increases to 178BPM, then back down to 175BPM. Set your Base GN to `175/162 * Current GN` and just read the start slow. The speedup section is too dense to easily do Soflan stuff there.
