# Pre-Floating
Let's bring it all together for a technique that I like to call Pre-Floating.

## Theory

Pre-Floating is where you store a Base GN and float back to it later, effectively letting you nullify **1** speed change in a chart by floating before the speed change. This can be used more than once in any given chart but is rarely used.

Here is a video of a Korean player called GGOMI playing the same chart used as an example for turning off lane cover, CHECKING YOU OUT [SPA]. You'll notice that they float BEFORE the speedup similar to turning off the lane cover, but they retain their white number. This is the magic of Pre-Floating.

## Method

But how do you store a GN? I didn't know that IIDX had an inventory system?!!!?!? While these steps may seem complicated at first, here are the steps for Pre-Floating.

1. Find a chart that you would like to utilise Pre-Floating on
2. Find the speed that you need to float to. Usually this will be the Green Number such that the max GN on the chart is your regular GN. For example, for CHECKING YOU OUT you would want to set your Base GN to double your regular GN
3. Gear Shift your new Base GN so that it is roughly equal to your regular Green Number (remember, Gear Shifting will not affect your Base GN!)
4. Float before the speedup so that when the chart speeds up it is scrolling at your regular speed
5. Profit

## Advantages

- You get to read the whole chart at your comfortable regular Green Number
- Synergises extremely well with charts where you can Pre-Float on Start + Scratch
- Extremely good for charts that speed up for peak and slow back down to an easy section

## Disadvantages

- Can be complicated to learn
- You will literally need a calculator for some charts (unreliable on AC)
- Becomes a crutch for charts with multiple speed changes if you can't read slow
