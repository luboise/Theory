Floating hi-speed is an alternative Hi-speed mode accessed by holding start and pressing EFFECT while utilising SUDDEN+. Its name comes from that fact that in this mode you can change your hi-speed to decimal (floating point) numbers, meaning that you can move your lane cover in such a way that you retain your Green Number. This Green Number is what all techniques in this guide will refer to as a Base Green Number, or Base GN for short. Your Floating hi-speed Base GN will persist between songs , meaning that you don't have to change it every chart You can switch between Floating hi-speed and regular highspeed by holding Start and pressing Effect . This is the only way to change your Base GN when using SUDDEN+ While you are in Floating hi-speed mode, start + turntable will no longer change your Green number Floating Hi-speed has a maximum base Hi-speed of 10.0x, and a minimum Hi-speed of 0.5x. This means that if you put your lane cover low enough, the game might not let you use the Green Number that you want (for example, DAY DREAM ) Floating If you are holding Start and move your turntable, no matter what Green number the chart has changed to, it will be reset back to your Base GN. This is referred to as Floating (not to be confused with Floating Hi-speed itself). Shown below is a video of IIDXtom playing \u5c11\u5e74A [SPA]. You will see him float after the bpm of the song changes from 90BPM to 192BPM, changing his GN from 157 back to his base GN of 334 so that he can comfortably read the rest of the chart. Floating without breaking combo is possible on some, but not all charts. You can float while hitting a scratch note at the same time by simply holding start while you hit it. WHEN TO USE FLOATING: When you can safely float without breaking combo When you forget the chart has soflan in it (just float to reset) For advanced techniques like pre-floating (covered under advanced techniques) Switching off the lane cover But what if the chart changes in BPM and doesn't give me a gap to reset my number? (looking at you, FUTURE is Dead ) One method of lowering your speed rather than floating back to your Base GN is removing the lane cover by pressing Start twice. This is simplest to understand if you have your White Number at 500. If you were to remove your lane cover, you would be able to see 2 times as much, effectively halving your scroll speed. While this technique is useful for charts that double in BPM using 500 White Number, in combination with Gear Shifting (shown below) it can be used on other charts like ICARUS and JOMANDA. In this video of DOLCE playing CHECKING YOU OUT [SPA], he turns off his lane cover before the song doubles in BPM so that it is readable when the chart changes. Final thing about the lane cover. Re-enabling SUDDEN+ by pressing start twice again will automatically float for you , meaning that if you are extremely picky about your White Number you can float by pressing start 4 times, leaving your precious WN untouched. WHEN TO DISABLE LANE COVER: When the song speeds up without an avenue to float easily, turn off lane cover before When you're about to enter a dense speedup When you'll need to float after a speed change but can't feasibly hit the turntable Gear Shifting Gear shifting refers to when you hold start and press the white or black keys. This will change your high speed up by 0.5x if you press a black key, and down by 0.5x if you press a white key. More importantly, this will not affect your Base GN, meaning that you can adjust your Green Number mid chart and still have the safety of being able to float back. Here's a video of DOLCE using gear shift on \u30e9\u30af\u30a8\u30f3 -JAKA respect for K.S.K Remix- [SPA]. After the song slows down he gear shifts up 6 times (3.05x --> 6.05x) by pressing the black keys. Before the speedup, he shifts back down 6 times by using the white keys.

Lift is an option that can be (but doesn't have to be) used in conjunction with SUDDEN+. It allows you to raise the judgement line from the bottom of the screen and also uses a White Number. Similar to SUDDEN+, your lift White Number has a max of 1000. Your Lift height can be changed by holding start and moving your turntable with your SUDDEN+ cover off (double tap start to enable). If your SUDDEN+ lane cover is enabled, this will move that instead. While using Floating Hi-speed, although Lift will affect exact ratios used to formulate White Numbers, your SUDDEN+ lane cover will function the same way. The most notable similarity is that with Lift off, trying to float with your lane cover off will destroy your Base GN. Similarly, altering your Lift height will destroy your Base GN. Advantages of Lift: Allows you to effectively change the size of the playfield Can make strategies where the lane cover is turned off more readable due to the smaller lane Helpful so that you don't have to powerstance as hard at the arcade Disadvantages of Lift: Complicates exact values that are used for calculating soflan strategies You may need to disable Lift for charts that have extreme soflan to read them Converting for lift players Any White Number given in this guide is given assuming that you are using 0 lift. If you are using Lift, you can convert the White Number in the guide to the White Number for your lift amount by multiplying it by (1000 - Lift) / 1000 Details about this formula are listed below. Disabling lane cover general formula If you want to turn off your lane cover to perfectly accomodate for a speedup, find out the old BPM, new BPM and use this formula. WN = (1000 - Lift) * (1 - OLDBPM / NEWBPM) Details for this formula are also listed below. Lane Cover Formulae What exactly happens to your GN when your lane cover is disabled/enabled? Is there a formula for this that we could use find exact values to set our WN to? Let's cover this first with Lift disabled (0 WN) for simplicity. The total length of the lane is 1000 units. This is why your SUDDEN+ and Lift lane covers have a max range of 1000. How does Green Number change when disabling SUDDEN+ ? The way your Green Number changes when disabling the lane cover is modelled by: New GN = 1000 / (1000 - WN) * current GN . If your WN was 500 (halfway down), turning it off would double your reaction time. From the formula, 1000 / (1000 - 500) = 1000/500 = 2 * GN. This checks out. If your WN was 666 (2/3 down), turning it off would triple your reaction time. From the formula, 1000 / (1000 - 666) \u2248 3 * GN. This checks out. Think of this as the ratio between the lane cover (WN) and maximum value of the lane cover (1000). This is best illustrated by this graph of how the formula affects 280GN. You can see how the function is bound between [0, 1000). The X-value of each coordinate is your WN and the y-value is your new Green Number. As your lane cover approaches 1000, your new GN approaches infinity. (At 1000 WN, the lane is completely invisible, so this makes sense). Enabling SUDDEN+ on Regular Hi-speed The way your Green Number changes when enabling the lane cover is modelled by New GN = (1000 - WN) / 1000 * current GN This formula is effectively the inverse change of the formula for disabling the lane cover. If your WN was 500 (halfway down), turning this lane cover on would halve your reaction time, halving your GN. From the formula, (1000 - 500) / 1000 * GN = 1/2 * GN. This checks out. If your WN was 666 (2/3 down), turning it on would cut your reaction time to a third, and in turn cut your GN to a third. From the formula, (1000 - 666) * GN \u2248 1/3 * GN. This checks out. The reverse function is linear, and you can clearly see from this graph how your GN is bound between your current GN, for example 280GN, and 0 (it can only get faster). The X-value of each coordinate is your WN and the y-value is your new Green Number. As your lane cover approaches 1000, your new GN approaches 0. (At 1000 WN, the lane is completely invisible, which means you'd have 0ms reaction time, and subsequently 0GN). Enabling SUDDEN+ on floating Hi-speed On Floating Hi-speed, enabling the lane cover will float back to your Base GN, so the formula isn't usable here. Lane Cover Formulae differences for Lift As lift changes the length of the playfield, how would the Lift value affect the formula? Well, the original formula is bound from [0, 1000). What we want is to bind between [0, 1000 - Lift), as the new size of the playfield is given by 1000 - Lift. For example, if you had a lift of 200, instead of having 1000 units of space you would have 1000 - 200 = 800, meaning your new formulae would be New GN = 800 / (800 - WN) * current GN for disabling SUDDEN+ and New GN = (800 - WN) / 800 * current GN for enabling SUDDEN+. More generally, the formulae for any lift amount (including 0 for lift off) are: Disabling SUDDEN+ : New GN = (1000 - Lift) / (1000 - Lift - WN) * current GN Enabling SUDDEN+ : New GN = (1000 - Lift - WN) / (1000 - Lift) * current GN Finding optimal SUDDEN+ White Numbers for disabling SUDDEN+ If you've seen Method 1 for Theory , you may be wondering how I came to the White Number 306 for the SUDDEN+ value. Let's obtain this number from scratch. Theory speeds up from 102BPM to 146BPM, and we want to find a SUDDEN+ cover such that turning it off will give us our Base GN. This means that we want our lane cover ratio for disabling the lane cover to be equal to the ratio between these 2 BPM values. To be more explicit, we want (1000 - Lift) / (1000 - Lift - WN) = 147/102 This can be rearranged to give WN = (1000 - Lift) * (1 - 102/147) If we plug in my lift value of 0, we get a final result of 1000 * (45/147) = 306.12 Round this number to 306 for your lane cover and that's your ideal lane cover for this situation.","title":"Lift and Formulae (IMPORTANT FOR LIFT PLAYERS)"},{"location":"resources/lift_formulae/#lift-and-lane-cover-formulae","text":"","title":"Lift and Lane Cover formulae"},{"location":"resources/lift_formulae/#what-is-lift","text":"Lift is an option that can be (but doesn't have to be) used in conjunction with SUDDEN+.

Regular Hi-speed in Rootage ranges from 1-10 set speeds. Previous IIDX versions use a multiplier in combination with the songs BPM to give you your Green Number. This is referred to as Classic Hi-speed. From Rootage onwards, similar to floating Hi-speed, regular Hi-speed is also consistent between songs. It doesn't matter if your chart is 140BPM or 300BPM, your Green Number will start at whatever value is shown in the table associated with your game. Changing speed (Gear Shifting) Gear shifting works completely differently for regular Hi-speed as opposed to floating Hi-speed. While floating Hi-speed always changes your Hi-speed by 0.5x, gear shifting for regular Hi-speed just changes your Hi-speed between speeds 1-20 on the table. This means that Regular Hi-speed does not have a Base GN, only a current speed Strategies that gear shift but require retaining a Base GN will need workarounds Gear shifting in Regular Hi-speed tends to change your Green Number by a smaller amount than it would using Floating Hi-speed, making it useful for charts where the BPM change is relatively small (less than 35BPM difference) While it may seem like the lack of a Base GN limits you (and in a lot of cases it does), there are still techniques that you can accomplish with Regular Hi-speed Floating Although regular Hi-speed doesn't use decimal Hi-speeds, it does have its own version of floating . Rather than the player having a Base GN that they can always fall back on by floating, each step from 1-20 in regular Hi-speed has its OWN Base GN. Think of it like this. Speed 18 has a Green Number of 300 Speed 19 has a Green Number of 281 Suppose you are playing on Speed 18 and the song's BPM changes setting you to 100GN (very fast and completely unreadable). Gear shifting up to speed 19 would overwrite this change, setting your Green Number to 281. Combine this initial speed change with a speed change back to 18, and you've effectively achieved a float using regular Hi-speed. WHEN TO USE \"FLOATING\": When you can safely float without breaking combo When you forget the chart has soflan in it (just float to reset) You can not use regular Hi-speed for Pre-floating . If you value this niche technique, you'll need to use Floating Hi-speed instead. Toggling the SUDDEN+ Lane Cover Switching the lane cover off functions identically to how it does for Floating Hi-speed. It sets your Green Number to 1000/(1000-x) * current GN .

While floating Hi-speed always changes your Hi-speed by 0.5x, gear shifting for regular Hi-speed just changes your Hi-speed between speeds 1-20 on the table. This means that Regular Hi-speed does not have a Base GN, only a current speed Strategies that gear shift but require retaining a Base GN will need workarounds Gear shifting in Regular Hi-speed tends to change your Green Number by a smaller amount than it would using Floating Hi-speed, making it useful for charts where the BPM change is relatively small (less than 35BPM difference) While it may seem like the lack of a Base GN limits you (and in a lot of cases it does), there are still techniques that you can accomplish with Regular Hi-speed","title":"Changing speed (Gear Shifting)"},{"location":"resources/reg_hs/#floating","text":"Although regular Hi-speed doesn't use decimal Hi-speeds, it does have its own version of floating . Rather than the player having a Base GN that they can always fall back on by floating, each step from 1-20 in regular Hi-speed has its OWN Base GN. Think of it like this. Speed 18 has a Green Number of 300 Speed 19 has a Green Number of 281 Suppose you are playing on Speed 18 and the song's BPM changes setting you to 100GN (very fast and completely unreadable). Gear shifting up to speed 19 would overwrite this change, setting your Green Number to 281. Combine this initial speed change with a speed change back to 18, and you've effectively achieved a float using regular Hi-speed.

If you can not hit non-ran patterns, and I don't mean less comfortable hitting them I mean that you literally can not hit them, consider learning the more difficult Method 2. Position your right hand so it covers start and button 6. You'll notice from the image above that the patterns alternate between key 1+3 and key 6. Your aim is to gear shift down by 6 anywhere in this section. The easiest way (in my opinion) to do this is to hold start and hit 9 times, using your right thumb to hit key 6. (13 --> 6 --> 13 --> 6 --> 13 --> 6 --> 13 --> 6 --> 13) What this will do is shift you down by 10 (because of the 10 white key presses) and then shift you up by 4 (because of the 4 black key hits), leaving you at a net 6 down. BONUS: Try and double tap start and hold it down on the second tap when you go for the gear shift chunk, before going for the chunk. This will turn your lane cover off before the gear shifts, and eliminate the need to turn it off later, and lets you focus all of the soflan down in a 2 second window. If you don't do this, you'll want to turn off your lane cover during any of the sections where there is no note on 6 (your off hand will be free to hit start). The purple circle is a deadline cut off, because by that point the song has reached 540BPM and it is starting to get out of hand. After the hyper fast section (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 5 4) the chart will slow down to be extremely slow because you have gear shifted it down by 6. You will need to read this slow. After the final black note, turn your lane cover back on at the purple line for that sweet sweet auto float, and you are done. The rest of the chart should be at your regular Green Number. DOLCE. also turns the lane cover back on in the same spot in the chart preview video, so give that another watch if you're still not sure where this is.

You will see his random gave him key2 + key4 then key1 (p1 equivalent key4 + key6 then key7). He only holds start while hitting key1, as this will shift him down, and needs to let go of start between the notes.

If you can't do this, the strategy will still work just not with perfect double/half GN numbers. Right as you are approaching the slow down there is a very low density section where you have a lot of time to adjust your Green Number. You want to gear shift enough times that you DOUBLE your floating hi-speed. Gear shifting always affects your hi-speed by 0.5x. So for example, if your hi-speed is 2.0x, you want to shift up 4 times.

Theory In IIDX 28 Bistrover, they altered floating hi-speed such that switching off your lane cover ALSO floats, not just turning it on. This means that tech reliant around having a specific white number and then removing your lane cover now requires regular hi-speed. The idea around LIFT Substitution is that it enables you to read without a SUDDEN+ cover without having to read the entire playfield by using a LIFT to cover it. For example, if you normally play with 100 SUDDEN+ and 200 LIFT, for a chart that speeds up you could use 300 LIFT and remove your SUDDEN+ cover mid chart. This allows you to toggle between 2 lane covers without reading 1000 playfield. Method Combine the WN of your SUDDEN+ cover and LIFT together and put 90-100% of that into your LIFT (100% if you can read with lots of WN, 90% if you prefer a bit of fast reading) Find the optimal WN for your sudden+ cover depending on the chart. For example, Marie Antoinette goes from 205BPM -> 248BPM, so you would set your SUDDEN+ to (1000 - Lift) * (1 - 205 / 248) (170ish) Disable your lane cover before the speedup. This method can also be used in reverse, where you begin the chart with no lane cover and then enable it. Useful for charts like SABER WING, where I personally turn on lane cover during the slowdown and off right after. Advantages You get to read the whole chart at your comfortable White Number, while also having flexibility for soflan Synergises extremely well with charts where you have a gap to mess around with your lane cover Extremely good for charts that speed up for peak and slow back down to an easy section and vice versa Disadvantages You have to look higher than you probably want You may need a calculator, although setting up precise numbers is actually easier with non-floating hi-speed Becomes a crutch for charts with multiple speed changes if you can't read high WN","title":"Advanced - LIFT Substitution"},{"location":"resources/tech/LIFTSub/#lift-substitution","text":"Here's an interesting tech that comes in handy for Bistrover and onwards.","title":"LIFT Substitution"},{"location":"resources/tech/LIFTSub/#theory","text":"In IIDX 28 Bistrover, they altered floating hi-speed such that switching off your lane cover ALSO floats, not just turning it on.
